# Chess-Ai

Initial idea is to create a simple chess 'ai' that can play at a very basic level. Choosing C++ for its object-oriented workflow, and to learn as well. The overlooked challenge of actually creating the game first will take some time
## Features


### Prerequisites

- A C++ 64-bit compiler (ex. GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SMFL)
- Basic make and lib linking knowledge

### Building

```mingw32-make``` ```make```

## Roadmap
- Highlight squares on click
- Place pieces in a forward thinking manner 
- Make pieces movable

## Design Choices
- Originally had an array 64 integers representing pieces 1-6 and 0 for empty squares,
and looped through to place pieces based on corresponding number

- But when I think about chess, I dont think of it as pieces as instanced on a board, not unique or individual.
They are each meaningful in their own right.
